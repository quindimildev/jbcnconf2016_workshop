  "body": "# Introduction\r\nAre you ready? Maybe not! For attending this workshop is compulsory having a minimal environment requirements installed. It's very important cause we are not going to do the following during the workshop.\r\n\r\n# Environment requirements\r\n## Operating System\r\nYou can use Windows, Linux or OSX. So if you are a Windows lover, don't worry, but Linux/OSX is better :D \r\n## JVM\r\nGrails works over a JVM, so at least JDK 1.7 have to be installed, feel free to use it, but we will use the 1.8 version instead.\r\n## Grails\r\nWe are going to use the lastest Grails version. The 3.1.8 version.\r\n### Manual installation\r\nInstall Grails is very easy, and even easier if you follow the Grails Documentation placed at:\r\n<http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/gettingStarted.html#requirements>\r\nDon't forget to download the 3.1.8 Grails version. \r\n### Installing Grails with a manager tool (Linux/OSX)\r\nIf you are installing Grail over Linux or OSX you can use sdkman.io It's the best an easy way to do it. How?\r\n* Install SDKMan following instructions placed at: <http://sdkman.io>\r\n* After install SDKMan, run on the terminal: sdk install grails 3.1.8, and that's all!\r\n\r\n### Check if Grails has been installed\r\nJust run `grails -version` on the terminal. You will see something similar to this:\r\n```\r\n    $ grails -version\r\n    | Grails Version: 3.1.8\r\n    | Groovy Version: 2.4.6\r\n    | JVM Version: 1.8.0_77\r\n```\r\n## Database\r\nWe are going to see how to connect Grails with a MySQL database. If you have a MySQL Server installed on your machine will be great, but it's not necessary. If you do:\r\n* Create a new schema\r\n* Create a user granted for use that schema\r\n\r\n# That's all!!!\r\nHope to see you at JBCNConf!",
